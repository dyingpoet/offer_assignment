Please modify the configuration file *.cfg and *init (used in the mixed offer assignment), and generate some small configuration data in ${CONFIG_FILE_PATH}/.


Below are some features we have added in V4 release.

1). Make the sequential OA flexible to upper bounds
In the previous version, it requires fixed upper bounds for each type of offers, say at most 2 reward offers (priority 1) and at most 4 recommend offers (priority 2) for an overall max  = 6 assignment. Here it enforces 6 = 4 + 2.
./mixed_offer_assignment
In the new version, the upper bounds could be flexible, say assign as many reward offers as possible (priority 1) and at most 4 recommend offers (priority 2) for an overall max = 6 assignment.
./mixed_offer_assignment_flexible_upperbound

2). Resolve the issue of offers falling in multiple sub-categories

3). Add strict-item-reward turn on/off option for the sub-cat reward OA.
In the old versions, the strict-item-reward is enforced such that only the coupon with items purchased will be qualified.
In the new version, we can turn on / off this eligiblity option.

4). Enhancement of backfilling logic

5). 1-many OA included
./1toMany_assignment

6). Make the postprocessing script appending meta info scalable








Below are some features we have added in V3 release.

1). Be able to backfill offers to any lower bould.

2). Be able to backfill offers to member without any scores.

3). Be able to add nonoffers in the output

4). Be able to turn on / off  the inventory check 

5). Support mixed type offer assignment offers. Please specify the types of offers in the file mixed_offer_assignment.init. The current implenmetation assigns offer sequentially based on the order of types specified in the init file.
