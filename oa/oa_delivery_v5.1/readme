Note that this is designed only for Club Insider campaigns.

For club insider: %reward offers assigned less than 20% for each item.
In the implementation, the %offer type constraint could only be applied to the last assignment of a mixed sequential assignment.


Use ./mixed_offer_assignment_flexible_upperbound/
